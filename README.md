# Academic CV Template

This repository provides a minimalist academic-style CV template designed for [typists](https://typst.app/). It includes an automatic CI (Continuous Integration) build process to streamline the creation of your CV in PDF format.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to create your academic CV:

1. **Modify the CV Data**: Open the `cv.typ` file and replace the template content with your own academic and professional details.

2. **Push Your Changes**: Commit your changes to your GitHub repository. This will trigger a GitHub Action to automatically build a PDF version of your CV as an artifact.

3. **Create Timestamped Releases**: To keep track of your CV's history and versions, consider tagging your commit to generate timestamped releases of the PDF. This way, you can easily access and share different versions of your CV.

4. **Link to the Latest Version**: The latest released version of your CV can be accessed using this URL: `https://github.com/{username}/{repository}/releases/latest/download/cv.pdf`.
